# Behavior Summary
Boat often has a habit of lying without caring about plausibility. Even if caught, he relies on time to let everything be forgotten. When faced with heavy social pressure, he deletes content, goes into hiding for a while, and then comes out to repeat the same behavior.
Boat has expertise in building communities. The main reason is because he likes to lie, leading many to believe him, especially young programmers who mistakenly think Boat truly has the abilities he claims.
In many cases, Boat often presents incorrect knowledge to others, such as summarizing sessions wrongly and secretly claiming to have a girlfriend who is a celebrity or other women.

# Risk Assessment Results

# Format for Contributing Pull Requests
To be fair to Boat, we will divide the content into two groups: rumor and fact.
Rumor refers to information without empirical evidence, such as stories told by victims, including events that no one recorded evidence of in time.
Fact refers to events with empirical evidence, such as screenshots, video clips (recommend making copies to prevent deletion, as he has a habit of deleting).
Those interested in adding content can create text files or folders and submit them in the following format:
File/Folder Name: event-group-event-name.md
Content: Write freely in the natural style of the author. Try to gather as much evidence as possible, and please study libel laws in detail. In cases with attached evidence, recommend creating it as a folder.

# Notes
Please be cautious and stay within the framework of this law.
Criminal Code, Section 330: In the case of defamation, if the accused can prove that the defamatory statement is true, that person shall not be punished. However, proof is prohibited if the defamatory statement concerns personal matters and the proof would not benefit the public.
In other words, present the truth that benefits society.
Benefiting society means jointly recording events, creating awareness, and hoping to reduce the number of future victims.
