.NET Session by Boat Charunthon<br>
This document presents technical observations regarding the consistency of the content presented in the .NET session, with the objective of ensuring transparency and academic correctness.

1. Data Consistency Issue<br>
Upon reviewing the presentation slides, it was stated that the benchmark was conducted using a model with 1.5B parameters.
However, during the live demonstration and actual execution by the speaker, a model with 0.5B parameters was used instead.<br>
This inconsistency between the information stated in the slides and the model used in practice may lead the audience to misunderstand the benchmark results and conclusions.

2. Suitability of the Model Used for Benchmarking<br>
In general, a 0.5B-parameter model has significant capability limitations and is not widely accepted for real-world use cases, either from a business perspective (Business Use Case) or a technical perspective (Production / Applied AI).<br>
Therefore, using results derived from such a model as a substitute for, or as a reference to, a 1.5B-parameter model may not appropriately reflect the system’s true performance or limitations.

3. Impact on Presentation Credibility<br>
Presenting benchmark results based on a model whose size and characteristics differ from those stated may constitute incomplete or misleading communication, potentially affecting the credibility of the content in both academic and professional contexts.
As such, this issue should be clearly clarified to allow the audience and readers to fairly assess the accuracy and validity of the information presented.
